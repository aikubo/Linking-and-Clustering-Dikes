### Starting a New Branch 
Let's say you want to change some aspect of the code to try it out. Rather than do this on the `master` copy. Try it on a new branch. A branch allows you to edit your own version of the code and then later merge the change back into the the main branch. 

```
git checkout -b <name of new branch>

```
